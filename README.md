```
Im just step away
Im just about the way
Cursing my fate today
Im falling of the yesterday
I aint just a man
A superhuman
Im a superhuman
Someone save me from the hade
Is just another war
Just another fairy core
Im fallong from my fit today
Just a step from the edge
Just another day in the world we live
I need a hero
To save me now
I need a hero to save me now
A hero would save me
Ive gotta fight today
To level another day
Speaking my mind today
Ive gotta make you stand
But i am just a man
